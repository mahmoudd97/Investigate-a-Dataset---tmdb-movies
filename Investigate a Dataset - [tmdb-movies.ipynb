Also, **use good coding practices**, such as, define and use functions to avoid repetitive code. Use appropriate comments within the code cells, explanation in the mark-down cells, and meaningful variable names. "

This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest.
